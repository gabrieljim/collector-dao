# Collector DAO

This is the fourth project for the Optilistic course.
Unfortunately, life got in the way and I didn't manage to add a test suite for this one.

## Project spec:

Collector DAO, a DAO that aims to collect rare NFTs.

- [x] Allows anyone to buy a membership for 1 ETH
- [x] Allows a member to propose an NFT to buy
- [x] Allows members to vote on proposals:
  - [x] With the ability to delegate votes to other members
  - [x] With a 25% quorum
- [x] If passed, have the contract purchase the NFT in a reasonably automated fashion.

There's a mockup NFT Marketplace contract that's there solely for the purpose of testing the NFT buying feature.
