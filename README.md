# Collector DAO

A DAO Smart Contract that aims to collect rare NFTs!

- Allows anyone to buy a membership for 1 ETH
- Allows a member to propose an NFT to buy
- Allows members to vote on proposals:
  - With the ability to delegate votes to other members
  - With a 25% quorum
- If passed, have the contract purchase the NFT in an automated fashion.

There's a mockup NFT Marketplace contract that's there solely for the purpose of testing the NFT buying feature.
